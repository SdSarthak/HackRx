## üöÄ Deployment

### Docker
```dockerfile
# Use the provided Dockerfile
docker build -t hackrx-api .
docker run -p 8000:8000 \
  -e GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key \
  -e API_KEY=your_api_key \
  hackrx-api
```

### Render (Recommended Cloud Platform)
```bash
# Quick deployment using Blueprint (render.yaml)
# 1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account
# 2. Connect to Render Dashboard
# 3. Create new Blueprint from your repository
# 4. Set environment variables (GEMINI_API_KEY, API_KEY)
# 5. Deploy automatically

# Your API will be available at: https://your-service-name.onrender.com
```

**üìñ For detailed Render deployment instructions, see [RENDER_DEPLOYMENT.md](./RENDER_DEPLOYMENT.md)**
